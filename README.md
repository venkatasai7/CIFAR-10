# Machine Learning Models Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.
- **Files:**
  - `cnn_model.py`: Contains the CNN model architecture.
  - `train_cnn.py`: Script to train the CNN on a dataset.
  - `evaluate_cnn.py`: Script to evaluate the trained CNN model.

### 2. Two-Layer Neural Network (2-Layer NN)

- **Description:** Simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers for basic classification tasks.
- **Files:**
  - `two_layer_nn.py`: Implementation of the 2-layer neural network using NumPy.
  - `train_two_layer_nn.py`: Script to train the 2-layer neural network.
  - `evaluate_two_layer_nn.py`: Script to evaluate the trained 2-layer neural network.

### 3. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks.
- **Files:**
  - `knn.py`: Implementation of the KNN algorithm using Scikit-learn.
  - `train_knn.py`: Script to train the KNN model on a dataset.
  - `evaluate_knn.py`: Script to evaluate the trained KNN model.

### 4. Logistic Neural Network (LNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of a logistic regression-based neural network for binary classification.
- **Files:**
  - `logistic_nn.py`: Implementation of the Logistic Neural Network using TensorFlow/Keras.
  - `train_logistic_nn.py`: Script to train the Logistic Neural Network.
  - `evaluate_logistic_nn.py`: Script to evaluate the trained Logistic Neural Network.

## Dataset Used

- **Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Description:** CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works.
