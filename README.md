# Machine Learning Models Implementation

This repository contains implementations of various machine learning models using Python and popular libraries like NumPy, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for image classification tasks using TensorFlow/Keras.


### 2. Two-Layer Neural Network (2-Layer NN)

- **Description:** Simple feedforward neural network with two hidden layers for basic classification tasks.

### 3. k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classification tasks.

### 4. Linear Neural Network (LNN)

- **Description:** Implementation of a linerar regression-based neural network for classification.

## Dataset Used

- **Name:** CIFAR-10
- **Description:** CIFAR-10 is a set of images that can be used to teach a computer how to recognize objects. Since the images in CIFAR-10 are low-resolution (32x32), this dataset can allow researchers to quickly try different algorithms to see what works.
